# Boolzapp

In this project I am replicating the layout and some of the functionality of the WhatsApp webapp.  
The project will be completed over the span of three separate milestones, and all three will be preserved in the repo separately in order to show my work at various stages of the project.

## Features

TBD

## Workflow

### Milestone 1

In this milestone I recreate the graphical interface of the webapp and populare the list of contacts dynamically with Vue.js.

JS:
1. Use v-for to populate the contact list with the relevant data. Use v-bind to access specific properties.
